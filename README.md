I used Streamlit for GUI, and inorder to install Streamlit on your Coumputer, run this on your command line:
pip install streamlit

To run your code, navugate to the folder containing the code on a terminal, and types:
streamlit run filename.py
It will open up the web browser, and your code is ready to be implemented.
